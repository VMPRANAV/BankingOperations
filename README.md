# Banking_Operations

Create a class Customer and three classes namely MobileBanking, RegularBanking and InternetBanking. The relation between the classes is shown in the figure below. A customer is offered the following services:
⮚ Regular banking – Cash Deposit, Cash Withdrawal
Note: On successful withdraw or deposit operation, the relevant attributes (accountBalance and transactionCount) are updated.
⮚ Mobile and Internet banking – Transfer amount
Note: Perform the following computation and deduct the amount from the customer’s account balance.
▪ Charge for the mobile alert = transactionCount X chargePerSms.
▪ Charge for the email alert = transactionCount X chargePerEmail
In mobile banking when the transactionCount exceeds permittedCount then chargePerSms is doubled. Assume relevant datatypes and use constructors appropriately.
Create a package called Banking and place the three classes MobileBanking, RegularBanking and InternetBanking inside the package. Import the Banking package in the customer class.
